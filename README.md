In this project, I created a routing-app in React JS, which includes:
- Working with **[react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)**.
- Working with **[Switch](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Switch)** statements.
- Working with **[Link](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link)** which provides declarative, accessible navigation around the application and prevents loading all bundles on every reload.
- Working with **[Navlink](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/NavLink)** that adds the styling attributes to the rendered element when it matches the current URL.
- Adding **route parameters**.
- Passing and fetching the **optional parameters**.
- Working with **[npm query-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string)**.
- Working with **[Redirects](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Redirect)**.
- Implementing the **Programmatic Navigation**.
- Working with **Nested Routes**.
- Working with **Protected Routes**.
- Extreme code refactoring and code optimization.
 
I used these concepts to implement an end-to-end **[movie management application](https://github.com/Ubaid45/ReactJS_movie-management)** which is deployed **[here](https://desolate-headland-28492.herokuapp.com/movies)**.
