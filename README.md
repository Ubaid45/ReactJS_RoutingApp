In this project, I created a routing-app in React JS, in which I implemented the following:
- Fetching the **async promise** data from **[JSONplaceholder REST API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)** via **[axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)**.
- Working with **react-router-dom**.
- Working with **Switch** statements.
- **Links** to prevent loading all bundles on every reload.
- Adding route parameters.
- Passing and fetching the optional parameters.
- Working with **[npm query-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string)**.
- **Redirects**.
- **Programmatic Navigation**.
- **Nested Routes**.
 
I used these concepts to implement an end-to-end **[movie management application](https://github.com/Ubaid45/Mastering_ReactJS.git)** which is deployed **[here](https://desolate-headland-28492.herokuapp.com/movies)**.
